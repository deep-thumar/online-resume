  At Rebbitweb, our team led the development of scalable web applications, leveraging my expertise in C# MVC and SQL Server to enhance system performance and security. With a focus on optimizing API performance, we implemented robust token management, ensuring secure and efficient communication. Our collaborative efforts resulted in streamlined database operations and the on-time delivery of high-quality features.
  
  As a mentor, I supported junior developers in honing their skills in best practices and coding standards, reflecting my commitment to knowledge sharing and team growth. My educational journey culminated with a Master of Science degree in Information Technology, solidifying a foundation that integrates advanced technical skills with a strategic understanding of software development and data management.
